<p>In the first map the Roman Empire is in full swing, with the Teutonic tribes to the north, and the Slavs, Balts and Finns to the north-east. In the south-east we see the Parthian Empire, and to the east the steppes are occupied by Iranian peoples. Apart from the acquisition of Dacia and of Nabatea by the Roman Empire, little on the map has changed for at least 70 years.</p>
