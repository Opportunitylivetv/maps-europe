<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Should the Bosporan Kingdom appear on the map? Wikipedia says: <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporan_Kingdom">With the coins of the last king Rhescuporis VI in 341, constructing a chronology becomes very difficult. The kingdom was probably finally overrun by the Huns, who defeated the nearby Alans in 375/376 and moved rapidly westwards towards the Roman empire.</q></p>
