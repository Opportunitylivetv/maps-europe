<p><span class="date">452</span> Attila dies and his empire is destroyed by a German revolt, led by the Gepids at the Nedao river in Hungary. </p>
<p><span class="date">455</span> After taking the Balearic, Corsican, Sardinian islands and Sicily, Gaiseric sacks Rome. He later relinquishes most of Sicily to Odoacer.</p>
<p><span class="date">470</span> Kutrigur and Utigur remnants of Attila's empire contest lands in the Russian steppe.</p>
<p><span class="date">470s</span> The Visigoths push their Gallic boundaries towards the Rhone and Loire, and take over most of Iberia, other than the lands occupied by the Suevi and the Basques.  The Burgundians take the Rhone valley from the Romans, and the Franks and Alemanni divide the north-east between them. British chieftains flee to Brittany. Otherwise, the north-west is held by the Roman patrician, Syagrius.</p>
<p><span class="date">475</span> The Ostrogoths invade the Balkans in 475, then reoccupy the old Visigothic settlement along the lower Danube.</p>
<p><span class="date">476</span> The German general Odoacer takes control of what becomes the Kingdom of Italy, and the emperor Romulus Augustus is dismissed.</p>
