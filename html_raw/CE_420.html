<p><span class="date">407</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain crosses the channel to reinforce his imperial claim, but doesn't engage the advancing German tribes, nor the Franks, Burgundians and Alemanni, who take land on the left of the Rhine.</p>
<p><span class="date">408</span> Stilicho is murdered on the orders of Emperor Honorius.</p>
<p><span class="date">409</span> Gerontius rebels against Rome and sets up his own emperor, Maximus, in Hispania. The civil war that ensues allows the Suevi, Vandals and Alans to enter Iberia and ravage the countryside.</p>
<p><span class="date">410</span> Alaric the Visigoth obtains a ransom for Rome and sets up a puppet emperor, but is unable to remove Honorius from Ravenna. He then sacks Rome. Alaric then travels to the toe of Italy to get access to the Africa grain-growing areas, but has no boats to get to Sicily. He turns around, but dies shortly after.</p>
<p><span class="date">411</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain  is killed by Romans and Britain falls out of the Empire. </p>
<p>The Alans, Vandals and Suevi divide up Iberia between themselves. The Suevi and the Asding Vandals shared the northwestern province of Gallaecia, the Siling Vandals settle in Hispania Baetica, and the Alans in  Lusitania and Hispania Carthaginensis.</p>
<p><span class="date">412</span> Led by Athaulf, Alaric's successor, the Visigoths arrive in southern Gaul, but again need supplies. They agree to clear Spain of the Suevi and Vandals in return for lands in Gaul.</p>
<p><span class="date">416</span> The Visigoths rout the Siling Vandals and the Alans, but leave the Suevi and Asding Vandals in the north-west corner of the Iberian peninsula. The Alans seek shelter with the Asding Vandals.</p>
<p><span class="date">418</span> The Visigoths arrive in south-west Gaul and set up a kingdom as foederatii.</p>
<p><span class="date">419</span> Conflict arises between the Suevi and the Asding Vandals, but Roman intervention averts a Suevi defeat. The Romans force the Asding Vandals to move to Baetica, leaving the Suevi in sole possession of the north-west of the peninsula.</p>
