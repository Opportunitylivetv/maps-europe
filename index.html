<section>
<p>These are notes I'm taking, in SVG map form, as I study European history. A key aim here is to allow me to switch from map to map and see how boundaries evolve across an unchanging, Europe-wide background.</p>
<p>The large links below open an SVG map in a separate window. The commentary on this page fills in information about the major historical changes, in chronological order, as you move from one map to another. I suggest that you open both windows side by side, if you are able.</p>
<p>The notes about the maps  below are derived mostly from information in Colin McEvedy's excellent series of  books, in particular  <cite>The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History</cite>. To create the maps themselves, I typically start with boundaries suggested by McEvedy, but then use detailed information in other sources, such as the <cite>Times History of Europe</cite>. Wikipedia provides a lot of helpful information. So, in the end they are composed from many different sources. I didn't do a good job of noting the sources before the end of April 2016, so there needs to be some reconstruction here, which will take place as time and opportunity permits.</p>
<p>Boundaries are <em>approximate</em> for a number of reasons: first, in the earlier times especially, the borders were only approximate anyway; second, I have usually deduced the boundary information from small-scale maps, and sometimes the lack of geographical features makes accuracy difficult; third, the sources often differ about where boundaries lay, or are tied to dates that are slightly different. <em>You should therefore treat the boundaries on the maps as approximate.</em> However, at this scale, and in order to provide an idea of key changes at the European level, this is typically sufficient.</p>
<p>At the top right of each map you have options that bring things in and out of the map. These include: schematic vs. relief background, country  borders vs. none, old vs. modern place names and city names, rivers vs none. Note, however, that the relief map comes with some  rivers already marked.</p>
<p>The background map by Tubs is available from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BLANK_in_Europe_%28relief%29_%28-mini_map%29.svg">Wikimedia commons</a>. The rest is hand drawn by myself.</p>

<p>In the first map the Roman Empire is in full swing, with the Teutonic tribes to the north, and the Slavs, Balts and Finns to the north-east. In the south-east we see the Parthian Empire, and to the east the steppes are occupied by Iranian peoples. Apart from the acquisition of Dacia and of Nabatea by the Roman Empire, little on the map has changed for at least 70 years.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Should the Bosporan Kingdom appear on the map? Wikipedia says: <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporan_Kingdom">With the coins of the last king Rhescuporis VI in 341, constructing a chronology becomes very difficult. The kingdom was probably finally overrun by the Huns, who defeated the nearby Alans in 375/376 and moved rapidly westwards towards the Roman empire.</q></p>

<p><span class="date">376</span>  The Huns push forward to the Danube, crushing the Visigoths and enslaving the Gepids. Emperor Valens permits the Visigoths to cross the Danube into Roman territory to seek sanctuary. They are followed by Ostrogoths.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>McEvedy shows the northern part of Pannonia, around Lake Balaton, as Hunnic territory in 406 CE, whereas all of several other maps I looked at show the Roman border intact. Since Attila the Hun was apparently born in Pannonia around 406, I'm led to think that McEvedy was right, but to hedge my bets I overlapped the two territories. The book i'm reading about Attila the Hun indicates that the Huns were allowed to slowly settle that area over the period in question by Aetius.</p>
